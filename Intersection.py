class Intersection:
    pass



#manages the creation of vehicles and pedestrians
#manages the timings of signals, events and also changes made by the admin
#sets variables used by the vehicles and pedestrians
   #these variables allow them to determine when to go into the intersection or not



   # 12-16 threads for locations on the roads at the intersection, 4 for sidewalks, 3 per enterance for cars on the intersections
   # are joined after the end of the loop
   # have a while loop for the whole system here, possibly treat this class as a object
   # other objects such as cars and such check the variables changed by the threads to move through the intersection or not
   # ie for emergencies, we can set x areas of the 16 to be filled for y amount of time

   #4 threads for the 4 sets of lights (1 of each per road), 2 stoplights, 2 pedestrianlights
   #these threads will source info for multiple light objects
   #can be terminated here, and run with ifstatements for the light timings, and or possibly the sleep timings to adjust the durations
